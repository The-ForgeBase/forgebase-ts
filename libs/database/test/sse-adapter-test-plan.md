- **Test route handling**: Verify that Express routes correctly handle SSE requests.

### 2.3 Other HTTP Server Frameworks

- **Test with Fastify**: Verify that the SSE adapter works with Fastify.
- **Test with Koa**: Verify that the SSE adapter works with Koa.
- **Test with Hono**: Verify that the SSE adapter works with Hono.

### 2.4 Client-Side SDK Integration

- **Test DatabaseSDK**: Verify that the DatabaseSDK correctly integrates with the SSE adapter.
- **Test subscription API**: Verify that the subscription API works correctly.
- **Test event handling**: Verify that events are correctly handled by the client.

## 3. Performance Tests

### 3.1 Comparative Performance Tests

- **Test message throughput**: Compare message throughput between WebSocket and SSE adapters.
- **Test latency**: Compare message latency between WebSocket and SSE adapters.
- **Test memory usage**: Compare memory usage between WebSocket and SSE adapters.

### 3.2 High Volume Tests

- **Test with high message frequency**: Verify performance with high message frequency.
- **Test with large messages**: Verify performance with large messages.

### 3.3 Concurrency Tests

- **Test with many connections**: Verify performance with many concurrent connections.
- **Test with many tables**: Verify performance with many tables.

## 4. Browser Compatibility Tests

### 4.1 Desktop Browsers

### 4.3 Network Conditions

- **Test behind proxy**: Verify that the SSE adapter works behind a proxy.
- **Test behind load balancer**: Verify that the SSE adapter works behind a load balancer.
- **Test with CORS**: Verify that the SSE adapter works with CORS.

## 5. Edge Case Tests

### 5.1 Connection Handling

- **Test reconnection**: Verify that clients can reconnect after a connection loss.
- **Test connection timeout**: Verify behavior when a connection times out.

### 5.2 Network Conditions

- **Test with slow connection**: Verify behavior with a slow connection.
- **Test with intermittent connection**: Verify behavior with an intermittent connection.

### 5.3 Error Handling

- **Test with malformed messages**: Verify behavior with malformed messages.
- **Test with invalid permissions**: Verify behavior with invalid permissions.
- **Test with non-existent tables**: Verify behavior with non-existent tables.

## 6. Documentation Tests

- **Test examples**: Verify that all examples in the documentation work correctly.
- **Test integration guides**: Verify that the integration guides are accurate and complete.
- **Test API documentation**: Verify that the API documentation is accurate and complete.

## Test Execution Plan

1. Implement unit tests first to ensure basic functionality.
2. Implement integration tests to verify framework compatibility.
3. Implement performance tests to compare with WebSocket adapter.
4. Implement browser compatibility tests to ensure wide support.
5. Implement edge case tests to ensure robustness.
6. Review and update documentation based on test findings.

## Reporting

Test results will be reported in the GitHub issue #76 with detailed information about any failures or issues encountered.
