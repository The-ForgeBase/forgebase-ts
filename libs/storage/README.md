# ForgeBase Storage

The ForgeBase Storage library provides comprehensive file and object storage capabilities for the ForgeBase ecosystem. It offers a unified interface for working with various storage providers while supporting efficient file operations and access control.

## Purpose

This library simplifies storage operations by providing an abstraction layer that works with multiple storage providers. It handles common storage tasks like file uploads, downloads, permissions management, and metadata handling, allowing developers to focus on their application logic rather than storage implementation details.

## Core Features

- Authentication & Authorization: Fine-grained role, table, and namespace-level permissions.
- Database Integration: Compatibility with modern real-time databases like RethinkDB, SurrealDB, etc.
- Object Storage: Built-in support for object storage solutions.
- Extendability: Easy to add custom routes and extend functionality beyond the BaaS features.
- Real-time Features: Full real-time support for db, presence, etc.

## Why This Framework?

Our mission is to simplify backend development by providing a highly flexible, language-agnostic BaaS framework that developers can plug into their existing server setup. While we are 70% inspired by Pocketbase, we recognized its limitationsâ€”particularly its dependency on SQLite and its inability to scale horizontally. To overcome these challenges, we are building a better alternative that not only supports horizontal scaling but also integrates with more robust databases like PostgreSQL, SurrealDB, etc. This approach ensures that our framework is scalable, versatile, and suitable for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large, distributed systems.
