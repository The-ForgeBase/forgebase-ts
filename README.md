✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/node?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve nest-test
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build nest-test
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project nest-test
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:app demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:lib mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.

## Overview of Packages

This project contains several packages, each with its own documentation. Below is an overview of all packages in the project along with links to their respective documentation:

- [Auth](libs/auth/README.md): A flexible authentication library for Node.js applications, providing multiple authentication strategies and framework adapters.
- [API](libs/api/README.md): Provides API functionalities and integrations.
- [Common](libs/common/README.md): Common utilities and shared code used across the project.
- [Database](libs/database/README.md): Database management and integration.
- [Real-Time](libs/real-time/README.md): Real-time communication and updates.
- [Storage](libs/storage/README.md): Storage management and integration.
- [Studio UI Utils](libs/studio-ui-utils/README.md): UI utilities for the Studio application.

Each package's documentation provides detailed information on features, usage examples, and configuration instructions.

## Purpose of the Project

The BaaS Framework is an open-source Backend as a Service (BaaS) framework designed to provide backend functionality for a variety of backend frameworks across multiple languages, including but not limited to:

- Go
- TypeScript
- Rust
- PHP
- Deno
- Node.js
- and more!

## Core Features

- Authentication & Authorization: Fine-grained role, table, and namespace-level permissions.
- Database Integration: Compatibility with modern real-time databases like RethinkDB, SurrealDB, etc.
- Object Storage: Built-in support for object storage solutions.
- Extendability: Easy to add custom routes and extend functionality beyond the BaaS features.
- Real-time Features: Full real-time support for db, presence, etc.

## Why This Framework?

Our mission is to simplify backend development by providing a highly flexible, language-agnostic BaaS framework that developers can plug into their existing server setup. While we are 70% inspired by Pocketbase, we recognized its limitations—particularly its dependency on SQLite and its inability to scale horizontally. To overcome these challenges, we are building a better alternative that not only supports horizontal scaling but also integrates with more robust databases like PostgreSQL, SurrealDB, etc. This approach ensures that our framework is scalable, versatile, and suitable for a wide range of applications, from small projects to large, distributed systems.
