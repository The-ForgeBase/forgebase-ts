## Purpose

ForgeBase API is a flexible, framework-agnostic API library that provides a unified interface for handling HTTP requests, database operations, and file storage across various Node.js frameworks. It enables developers to easily integrate ForgeBase backend services into their applications by abstracting away the complexity of direct service interactions.

## Core Features

### Framework Integration

- **Express.js** adapter with middleware support
- **NestJS** modules (ForgeApiModule and ForgeApiWithChildModule)
- **Fastify** adapter with plugin system
- **Hono** adapter for edge compatibility
- Framework-agnostic core for custom integrations

### Database Operations

- CRUD operations with type safety
- Schema management and migrations
- Query builder with filtering and pagination
- Real-time updates (optional)
- Row-level security (RLS)
- Permissions management

### Request Handling

- Unified request/response interface
- Route parameter parsing
- Query string handling
- Body parsing with validation
- Header management
- Cookie support

### Middleware System

- Request/response pipeline
- Authentication middleware
- Admin request handling
- Custom middleware support
- Error handling middleware

### Security Features

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting
- API key authentication
- Admin request validation

### Storage Integration

- Local file system storage
- Cloud storage providers
- File upload/download
- Stream support
- Bucket management
- Access control

### Configuration Management

- Environment-based config
- Service configuration
- Dynamic updates
- Validation
- Defaults handling
